## 💬 Developer’s Note

I'm still learning JavaScript, so this portfolio is currently focused on design and layout.  
The interactive parts (theme toggle, animations, project filtering, etc.) will be added later.

Every section was built from scratch — no frameworks or templates used.  
This project represents my true learning journey 🚀
